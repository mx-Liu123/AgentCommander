# Auto-Setup Wizard

The Auto-Setup Wizard (`scripts/ml_autosetup_*.sh`) is the fastest way to initialize a robust, AgentCommander-compatible experiment environment.

## Scenario 1: Data-Only (`ml_autosetup_1`)

**Use Case**: You have a dataset (`X.npy`, `Y.npy`) but no model code. You want the Agent to build a model from scratch.

### Workflow
1.  **Input**: Path to your data directory.
2.  **Splitting**: The script runs `split_data.py` to create `X_train.npy`, `X_test.npy`, etc.
3.  **Generation**: The Agent generates an initial `strategy.py` and `metric.py` based on your description.
4.  **Verification**: Runs a dry run to ensure the generated code runs.

## Scenario 2: Bring Your Own Code (`ml_autosetup_2`)

**Use Case**: You already have a training script (`strategy.py`) and want the Agent to optimize hyperparameters or architecture.

### Requirements (The BYOC Protocol)
To use this mode, your code must adhere to a simple interface contract so the Evaluator can judge it:

1.  **Weight Saving**: Your script must save the best model weights to a file (e.g., `best_fast.pt`).
2.  **Loading Interface**: You must implement a factory function:
    ```python
    def load_trained_model(path, device):
        # Return the loaded model object
        return model
    ```
3.  **Data Protocol**: Your code should load data using the shared `experiment_setup.py` module (generated by the wizard) to ensure train/test splits are consistent between the Player (Strategy) and the Judge (Evaluator).

### What it Generates
*   `experiment_setup.py`: Locks the random seed and data splits. Immutable.
*   `evaluator_ref.py`: A template evaluator that loads your model and tests it against the reserved test set.

## Common Features
*   **Metric Standardization**: Both modes verify that the evaluator prints `Best metric: {val}` (lowercase 'm') for the workflow to parse.
*   **Safety Checks**: Both modes include anti-cheating checks (e.g., verifying `y_test` was not modified in memory).
