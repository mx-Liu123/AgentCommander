AgentCommander is an advanced, **graph-based workflow execution engine** designed to orchestrate AI Agents for complex, iterative scientific tasks. Built on top of the **Gemini CLI**, it enables Machine Learning engineers to construct highly customizable, infinite-loop workflows.

## Philosophy: Human-Centric Evolution

Unlike "set and forget" evolutionary algorithms (like **AlphaEvolve** or **OpenEvolve**) where agents are left to mutate randomly in a vacuum, AgentCommander is built for **Collaborative Discovery**.

*   **You are the Commander**: You define the search space, the hypothesis generation logic, and the evaluation metrics via a visual workflow.
*   **AI is the Executor**: The agent handles the exhaustive, repetitive loop of coding, debugging, and refining.
*   **Transparent & Controllable**: We prioritize white-box transparency. Every step is logged, every file is accessible, and you can intervene at any moment.

## Key Capabilities

* **Symbolic Regression**: Automating the search for mathematical expressions.
* **ML Structure/Hyperparameter Optimization**: Intelligent tuning without manual intervention.
* **Autonomous Model Refinement**: Self-correcting loops for model improvement.
