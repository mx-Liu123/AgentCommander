# Workflow Design

The Workflow Editor is the command center of AgentCommander. It allows you to visually design the logic flow of your AI agents.

## Key Concepts

*   **Nodes**: Individual steps (e.g., LLM Generation, Python Script, Shell Command).
*   **Edges**: The flow of execution.
*   **Subloops**: Encapsulated logic blocks (like the Experiment Subloop) that simplify the main view.

## AI Assistant
Click the **'AI Assistant'** button to modify the graph using natural language (e.g., 'Add a check after step 2').
