Lower is better.\n\nWorkflow:\n\nModify extract_features in @strategy.py: Combine technical indicators (TALib), price/volume transforms, and temporal features.\n\nEvaluate: The external system runs evaluator.py, which trains your model on historical data and tests it via Walk-Forward Analysis.\n\nIterate: Use the feedback (NLL Loss Score) to refine your feature set. If the score is high, your features are not informative enough.\n\nConstraints:\n\nStationarity: Inputs must be relative/normalized (e.g., Price / MA, not raw Price).\n\nCausality: No future data peeking.\n\nStability: Avoid NaN/Inf values. Use log1p for skewed distributions like Volume or Time.\n\n\u76ee\u524d10 ep\u7684metric loss is 7~10.\u4f46\u662f\u8c03\u6574\u621020ep\u4e4b\u540eloss\u7206\u70b8\u9ad8.\u89e3\u51b3\u5b83",
